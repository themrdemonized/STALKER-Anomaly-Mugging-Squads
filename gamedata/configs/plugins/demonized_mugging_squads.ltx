; Mugging squads

; Original description by billwa
; Basically they yell a quote, surround you and a guy comes up to talk and you have 3 dialogue [ptions. Pay  mugging fee, get forced into kidnapping and the classic resist.
; Obviously when if you start shooting them before you're they're able to open up their yappers, all bets are off and it's a normal gun fight
; Monolith and sin will try kidnapping you always, no mugging. If you agree, it should bring you back to a base where all of your gear is removed until you convert and you have two options before you do, agree or fight, but lmao with no gear.
; It is entirely random and happens anywhere on the map except interiors like labs or main bases.
